# Multi-Language Code Translation Examples

This directory contains example code snippets in over 15 programming languages, each implementing the same core logic: a greeting function and an addition function. These examples are designed to help test and demonstrate the capabilities of advanced code translation systems, including:

- **Simple and idiomatic syntax**
- **Functions, types, and main entry points**
- **Comments and formatting**
- **Potential for extension to more complex patterns**

For best results, upload these files to your code translation assistant (such as OpenAI Assistants with File Search enabled) and use them as references or test cases for multi-language translation, context extraction, and understanding.

## Included Languages
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Ruby
- PHP
- Swift
- Kotlin
- Rust
- TypeScript
- Scala
- Haskell
- Perl
- R
- MATLAB
- Julia
- Dart

---

## Usage
- Use these files as input for code translation tasks.
- Compare translations for accuracy, idiomatic usage, and preservation of logic.
- Extend with more complex code as needed for advanced testing.

## Example Prompt for an Assistant

```
Translate the code in `hello.py` to Rust. Ensure the output is idiomatic Rust and preserves all logic and comments. If any libraries are referenced, map them to Rust equivalents.
```

## Note
For complex code translation, consider also uploading:
- Project documentation (README, docstrings)
- Test files
- Dependency files (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)

This helps the assistant gain context and produce more accurate, robust translations.
